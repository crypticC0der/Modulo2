#+TITLE: plan
* modulo2
this is the second iteration of the idea of an abstract tower defence game
this is weirdly more inspired by risk of rain that it is bloons or mindustry
alot of how you buff towers will be through items that give effects, think tesla coil from ROR1/2

ok so rundown,
you exist ur a small person runnin around a giant area and theres a timer
in your inventory you have a couple basic components to build defences

the goal of the game will be to survive both your own defences and the enemies pursuit of you

the way the defences work will be the main thing, so you get a base and you can give it a head that will give it the ability to attack
not neccicary but like very reccomended,
currently i have like 4 ideas for heads:
- flamethrower
- laser turret
- rocket(possibly unneciary)
- generic gun

each of these attacks will have proc coefficents based on their defult rate of hit per second so any on hit effects with the laser turret arent broken af
you upgrade the towers by placing modifiers next to their base
(yes this means modifiers can effect multiple towers)
the normal modifers like dmg up will only take up a 1x1 tile, bases take up 3x3
some better upgrades might take up liek 2x2 or 1x2 depending on their power

the two interesting things about this aside from the emergent gameplay with funny effects and tinkering with them, is how the towers attack
yes both two things are that one thing
** thing one
basically they dont target by default, by default they will just rotate their head and shoot without any regard of the enemies or your position
you will be ably to add targeting system modifiers (in the game modifiers will be called modules, hence the name) that will focus on things and shoot instead of shooting randomly
this is where thing 2 comes in
** thing two
you arent considered diffeent by the towers
so if you get hit by a projectile you will get hurt just like the enimies do
and if you give it targeting system 1 it will target you as well (target system 2 does then recognise you) and you can get caught in crossfire

now why owuld this be an issue, you will be away from the towers and the enimies spawn wave by wave

wrong, enemies will be coming constantly and you wanna know how you upgrade
sure hope theres a section about that
** upgrading/resources
so you can find resources on the map and you spawn with some *but* enemies drop wepons and armor which can eb decrafted into resources
so easy, why is this intresting
its interesting cos enemies drop their shit where they die, and they will die realistically near your towers
so you have to approach your machines of death to try get these resources
and these machines unless very upgraded will not be able to tell u from enemies

** modules and upgrades
so towers will level up and get minor stat boosts cos of that, you can spend cash to level em up too but thats silly
towers will 'mutate' every 5 levels and gain a positive boost and a negative boost, these can b fun if i do em well
like lunar items from risk of rain, you dont get to choose what mutation they get, but you can choose wether to let it happen the first 3 times, after that it does it anyway

modules will be placed around towers, towers will have a range and if the modues are out of that range(probably like 1 tile around em, ill probably let users increase it at late levels) they dont get the effect
say if you have a 2x2 module and only half of it is in, im unsure on wether or not to either fully allow the effect or only slightly

also modules and towers can be destroyed

** enemies
i want enemies to naturally upgrade themselves, depending on how much valuables they steal from u by destroying your towers and time progression
itd be fun to have like a tree wherein they can obtain properties and add them to the tree so you can easily keep track of their weaknesses

** module types
uncommon - T1/T2/T3 (stat boosts) ie dmg up *light blue*
exotic - T1/T2/T3 (mechanical changes) ie targeting computer or the gun head *yellow*
rare - T1/T2/T3 (procables) ie on hit chance to make a explosion *purple*
epic - T1/T2/T3 (really cool and fun things) ie tesla coil *fushcia*

depending on their strength i will assign them enums, to dictate their y and x length

** crafting
i want to have like 6 bars
and you put more of certain ingredients in to change the ratios on the bars
the closer you are to the perfect ratio the better it will be
each resource will mean a specific thing
there will be 2 components to how good a thing is:
- how close it is to the desired ratio
  the higher this is, the higher the chance of mutations is
- how many resorces you put into it
  the higher this is, the more potent it is like multiple stacks in risk of rain

these two components mean that you need to figure out things by adjusting the amount youre putting in and you cant just shovel in a fuck ton of resources into a good recipie you find

*** components
- blade parts
  high damage
  all enemies
  red(ish, maybe)
- sparkon
  electricity
  stronger enemies
  dark blue (very different to soul)
- soul energy
  exotic components
  enemies but you need to be close
  whitey blue
- organic matter
  things that are oddly powerful/create life
  damaging yourself
  green
- low density metal
  everything really
  all enemies
  gray
- combustine
  fire weapons
  towers exploding, then killing the enemies that were caught in the explosion
  red/orange

*** keeping inventory
i am calling inventories decks like a sylladex from homestuck
they will be similar as in there are different types based off different data structures
i will not store resources in the deck
because the deck is for single quantity crafted items
